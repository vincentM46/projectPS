# projectPS

This project is a text-based Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA)-type game, detailing the players journey into the Cave of Chuck Norris to recover the Golden Hat of Chuck Norris to help their village.

This project utilizes HTML as a baseline web-page setup, JavaScript for web-page behaviors, and incorporation of a Chuck Norris Jokes API (https://api.chucknorris.io/).
Finally, the project uses CSS to style the web-page, including various box and style manipulations.

The project was done through the usage of forms, with radio inputs for each of the selections. This allowed for a smoother approach towards "guiding" the user through their own choices, and the greater story they were undergoing.

Here is a link to the deployed project: https://vincentm46.github.io/projectPS/?

If desired, the files can all be downloaded and viewed through a live server instead.


As per the rules laid out on the Canvas assignment page:

There are 2 players in the game: the user, and the various possible "failing" endings.
There are win states for the user: some endings result in a "win", where the player obtains the Golden Hat of Chuck Norris.
There are lose states for the user: some endings result in a "fail" or "game over", where the player falls victim to various traps, or detrimental events.
There are methods to continue playing: the reset button after a "game over" allows the player to go back in time to find a more beneficial alternative.
